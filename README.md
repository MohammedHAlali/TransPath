1.Download all [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22projects.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D) WSIs.

2.Download all [PAIP](http://wisepaip.org/paip) WSI

We crop these WSIs into patch images.we randomly select 100 images from each WSI.Finally,So, there will be about 2,700,521 unlabeled histopathological
images.If you want these images, you can contact me
The new better and stronger pre-trained models have [released](https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/RetCCL)
# TransPath(coming soon)

Better and stronger pre-trained models will be released, and more downstream tasks will also be tested.Our detailed extended paper will be completed in a few days（Delayed by 2 weeks due to some technical reasons）.We are planning to release many pre-trained models(2.12.2021 - 9.12.2021).
